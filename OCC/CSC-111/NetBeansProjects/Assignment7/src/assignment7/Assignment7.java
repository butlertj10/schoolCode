*Program Name   :   Assignment 07 - The Guessing Game
*Author         :   Trevor Butler
*Date           :   April 11th, 2018   
* Course/Section :   CSC 111 - 002 
*Program Description: Develop a program that simulates the high-low game. 
    * For each execution of the program, the game will generate a random    
    * number in the inclusive range of 1 to 100. The user will have up to 10
    * chances to guess the value. The program will keep track of all the userâ€™s 
    * guesses in an array. For each guess, the program will tell the user if 
    * his/her guess was too high or too low. If the user is successful, the
    * program will stop asking for guesses, display the list of guesses, and
    * show a congratulatory message stating how many guesses he/she took. If the
    * user does not guess the correct answer within 10 tries, the program will 
    * display the list of guesses, and show him/her the correct value with a 
    * message stating that he/she was not successful. Regardless of the outcome,
    * the program will give the user a chance to run the program again with a
    * new random number.
