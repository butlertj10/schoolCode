#+STARTUP: showall
#+TITLE: <TEMPLATE for C++ PROJECT>
#+SUBTITLE: CIS 310: Operating Systems
#+AUTHOR: Brian C. Ladd
#+DATE: Fall 2021

* Introduction
Project has the Makefile, AllModules.mk, module.mk, and executable.mk files to build a C++ program almost automatically.

* User Interaction

* Deliverables


* Building the project executables
This section assumes you are in the root directory of the project (the same directory with the ~Makefile~).

** Build the executables
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ make
#+END_SRC

** To Clean --- delete all generated files
The next build will have to compile /all/ of the files rather than just the ones that have changed. This is helpful if different, dependent packages get out of sync.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ make clean
#+END_SRC

Primarily deletes (recursively) the ~build/~ folder.

** To Test
No tests included in the template.

** To Run
No executable built
